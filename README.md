# üîó Machine Learning Experiments with Jupyter Notebooks

Welcome to the repository **"Data Science And Machine Learning Experiments with Jupyter Notebooks"**, where I have conducted a series of hands-on experiments covering essential topics in data science and machine learning using **Python**.  
Each experiment is implemented using **Jupyter Notebook**, and real-world datasets obtained from **Kaggle**.

## üìö Objectives

This repository aims to:

- Demonstrate practical data analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
- Apply statistical and machine learning techniques to real-world problems.
- Explore core machine learning algorithms with real datasets.
- Visualize data for meaningful insights and interpretation.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

Each notebook is organized around a key topic in data science or machine learning:

| # | Topic | Description |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **Data Acquisition using Pandas** | Loading and exploring CSV datasets using `pandas`. |
| 2 | **Central Tendency Measures** | Calculating **mean**, **median**, and **mode** to understand distributions. |
| 3 | **Basics of DataFrames** | Working with `pandas.DataFrame`: indexing, slicing, and basic operations. |
| 4 | **Missing Values Treatment** | Handling missing values using deletion and imputation techniques. |
| 5 | **Creation of Arrays using NumPy** | Creating arrays, reshaping, and performing array operations. |
| 6 | **Data Visualization** | Visualizing data using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`. |
| 7 | **Simple Linear Regression** | Implementing regression on datasets like `salary.csv`. |
| 8 | **Logistic Regression** | Binary classification using datasets like `titanic.csv`, `diabetes.csv`. |
| 9 | **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** | Applying KNN for classification tasks and optimizing *k*. |
| 10 | **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** | Building classification models with SVM. |
| 11 | **Decision Trees (DT)** | Visualizing decision-making using tree-based classifiers. |
| 12 | **Random Forest (RF)** | Using ensemble techniques for improved accuracy and robustness. |

## üìà Outcomes

By completing the experiments in this repository, I achieved the following outcomes:

- Gained practical experience with data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing.  
- Strengthened understanding of central statistical measures and their application.  
- Learned how to build, train, and evaluate multiple machine learning models.  
- Developed the ability to choose appropriate algorithms for classification and regression problems.  
- Improved data visualization and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) skills.  
- Built a solid foundation for more advanced machine learning and data science work.  

These outcomes reflect both theoretical understanding and hands-on coding experience.
